Dockerized Odoo for YunoHost
----------------------------
Warning: This YunoHost app is still in development. Use it at your own risk! I am **not** responsible for any data loss that jeopardizes your organization


**WARNING**: Odoo is a complex app. **DO NOT USE IT** to run your business unless you know what you are doing!!! If you don't, use <a href="https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/pricing-online#num_users=1&custom_apps=0">the hosted Odoo</a> that will give you peace and customer support!

Also this app exposes Odoo at "http://your_server_IP:8069" to access features unavaible behind Nginx. As a result, you should NEVER allow anonymous access to your Odoo, even if it is behind the YunoHost login!


**Important:** This app MUST be installed on a domain's root!

https://odoo.example.com/ will work

https://example.com/odoo/ will NOT work

http://your_server_IP:8069 **should be used for critical features such as installing modules or doing admin things**


What does not work
------------------
Several features of Odoo DO NOT work if you access Odoo via _domain.tld_ instead of _http://severIP:8069_ (e.g., backup/restore the database, install big modules...). This is because Odoo is not optimized to run behing Nginx.

Backup and restore

Login via YunoHost (you have to create user accounts in Odoo)

Autostart at server restart *might* not work


Odoo
----

Odoo is a suite of web based open source business apps.

The main Odoo Apps include an <a href="https://www.odoo.com/page/crm">Open Source CRM</a>, <a href="https://www.odoo.com/page/website-builder">Website Builder</a>, <a href="https://www.odoo.com/page/e-commerce">eCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.odoo.com/page/project-management">Project Management</a>, <a href="https://www.odoo.com/page/accounting">Billing &amp; Accounting</a>, <a href="https://www.odoo.com/page/point-of-sale">Point of Sale</a>, <a href="https://www.odoo.com/page/employees">Human Resources</a>, Marketing, Manufacturing, Purchase Management, ...  

Odoo Apps can be used as stand-alone applications, but they also integrate seamlessly so you get
a full-featured <a href="https://www.odoo.com">Open Source ERP</a> when you install several Apps.

Install procedure
----
First, you should add the subdomain to you yunohost configuration. For instance, we use odoo.domain.org.

You could do these steps from the admin panel (create a domain, install the app) but you can also install from the command-line:


```sudo yunohost domain add odoo.domain.org```

Then you can run

```sudo yunohost install https://github.com/scith/docker_odoo_ynh --label="Odoo"```

You will be asked for the domain

```Choisissez un domaine pour Odoo (Odoo sera install√© dans sa racine !) : odoo.domain.org```

You will be asked if it's a public instance (Direct acces without yunohost authentification). Be carefull because your website will be exposed and you should modify the default passwords.

Then, it should work, you just need to got to _odoo.domain.org_ to access to the database management page.

For critical things (e.g., backup/restore the database or install a module), you should access Odoo through _http://your_server_IP:8069_ instead of _http://odoo.domain.org_ to avoid any error.
