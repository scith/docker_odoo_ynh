Install procedure
----
First, you should add the subdomain to you yunohost configuration. For instance, we use odoo.domain.org.
 _Domain creation failed at some point when it has been done from the web adminstration inteface._
```sudo yunohost domain add odoo.domain.org```
Then you can run
```sudo yunohost install https://github.com/scith/docker_odoo_ynh.git```
You will be asked for the domain
```Choisissez un domaine pour Odoo (Odoo sera install√© dans sa racine !) : odoo.domain.org```
You will be asked if it's a public instance (Direct acces without yunohost authentification). Be carefull because your website will be exposed and you should modify the default passwords.

 Then, it should work, you just need to got to
 odoo.domain.org to access to the database management page.
